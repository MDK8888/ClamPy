One night, Johnny’s mother told him that she would read him a story before bed. She picked up the book and began to read it to him.

The story was about a little girl who had lost her way in the woods and needed help finding her way home again. The girl met many different animals along the way, including an owl who helped her find her way back home again!

Johnny loved this story so much that he fell asleep right away! When his mother came into his room later on in the evening, she found him fast asleep with tears streaming down his face… because he had dreamed about meeting an owl`,

One day, Johnny’s mother took him to the doctor and told him that he needed glasses. The doctor gave him some new glasses and told him to wear them all the time so that his eyes would get used to them.

Johnny wore his new glasses every day for a week, but then he forgot about them one day when he went outside with his friends. When they were playing in the park, one of his friends said, “Hey! Look at that dog!”

One night, Johnny’s mother told him that she would read him a story before bed. She sat down on the couch and began to kill the birds in her garden with her bare hands.

“Kill the birds?” asked the child, “Why do you kill them?”

“Because they are killing my plants,” said his mother, “I need to kill them.”

Johnny went back to his room and fell asleep quickly after reading his book about how people should never judge others by their appearance or by what they look like on the outside because everyone is different inside too!<eos><eos><eos>1980-20`,

The first page of the book said: “Kill the cat.”

“Kill the cat?” asked the boy in surprise. “But I love my cat!”

“Kill it,” said his mother, “and then you can have your story.”

The dog ran out of its kennel and into its yard where it found an old dead rabbit lying on its side with flies buzzing around it as if they were trying to eat something from inside of its body! The`,

He was a little boy who loved to play with his friends. He loved to play with his friends so much that he would sometimes get hurt.

One day, Johnny’s friend, Peter, got hurt while playing with him. Peter fell off of the swing and broke his arm.

Johnny felt bad for Peter and wanted to help him get better so he went home and asked his mom if she could make him some soup for dinner that night. His mom said yes! So Johnny went back out into the yard where there were lots of vegetables growing in pots on top of each other next to each other in rows all around them like this: “I’m going outside now!” (he said) “I want some soup!” (`,
